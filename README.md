## To run `Lucene project`
The Lucene library is required!
Download from our teacher's site: [Lucene_library](http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/mtomczyk/ir/lab7/lucene-7.2.1.zip) and follow instruction from his site:
"Download **lucene-7.2.1.zip** and unzip it in the projectâ€™s directory. Add the following jars to your project: `lucene-core-7.2.1.jar`, `lucene-queryparser-7.2.1.jar` and `lucene-backward-codecs-7.2.1.jar`."
